    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing was also done. The null hypothesis was that racism did not exist where our difference in callback rate was zero on average, and our alternative hypothesis was that racism did exist and difference in callback is not zero. We got a p-value of 0.097741. This is above the standard p value that denotes statistical significance, thus we have to say that some racial discrimination exists. Average education level and work experience was same for both applicants. Also, females are asked to come in for interviews in greater percentages."
